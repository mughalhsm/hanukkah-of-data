# Hanukkah of Data

Hanukkah of Data is a series of data-themed puzzles, where you solve puzzles to move your way through a holiday-themed story using a fictional dataset. The challenge consists of 8 puzzles.

## Puzzles

The puzzles are designed to test your data analysis and problem-solving skills, and require you to explore the dataset and uncover hidden patterns and insights. Each puzzle consists of a set of tasks that you need to complete in order to progress to the next puzzle. The puzzles are:

* Private Investigator - The first daily puzzle involves finding a customer whose phone number matches their last name as typed on a phone's keypad.

* Contractor - In the second puzzle, we find that the rug in our story was so dirty that the cleaners needed help from a special contractor.

* Spiderman - we learn that the rug passed from a contractor to someone in his neighborhood who was born in the year of the dog.

* Tinder Date - we find a woman who likes to eat pastries early in the morning.

* A cat lady! - And that's where the rug went next.

* Bargin - everything at a loss.
